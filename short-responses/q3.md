# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer

They are javascript functions, responsible for handling logic associated with different endpoints. They each have 3 arguments: res, req, and next. Which seem to be objects that contain functions, like what you can make when writing classes.
